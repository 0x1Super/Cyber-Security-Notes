Hard to completely prevent, but we can make it more difficult on an attacker:
- Limit account re-use
	- Avoid re-using local admin password
	- Disable Guest and Administrator accounts
	- Limit who is a local administrator (least privilege)
- Utilize strong passwords
	- The longer the better (>14 characters)
	- Avoid using common words
	- I like long sentences 
- Privilege Access Management (PAM)
	- Check out/in sensitive accounts when needed 
	- Automatically rotate passwords on check out and check in 
	- Limits pass attacks as hash/password is strong and constantly rotated
