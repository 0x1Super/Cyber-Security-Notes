# 1-  Broken access Control
Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or performing a business function outside the user's limits and can lead to:

- Violation of the principle of least privilege or deny by default
- Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL
- Permitting viewing or editing someone else's account
-  Accessing API with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE.
- Elevation of privilege


		Prevention

	- Access control mechanism  
	- Record ownership 
	- Log access control failure
	- Rate limit APIs
	- Least Privileges
