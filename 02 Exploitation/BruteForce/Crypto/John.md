--single - This flag lets john know you want to use the single hash cracking mode.

Example Usage:

john --single --format=raw-sha256 hashes.txt

A Note on File Formats in Single Crack Mode:

If you're cracking hashes in single crack mode, you need to change the file format that you're feeding john for it to understand what data to create a wordlist from. You do this by prepending the hash with the username that the hash belongs to, so according to the above example- we would change the file hashes.txt
